            <h2>Analogies is an archive comparing natural and man-made structures and their associated functions. In biology, structure almost always dictates function. For example, the arm of a tree branching off from its trunk improves the tree’s ability to photosynthesize by allowing leaves to hang further away from the main body of the tree trunk – thus increasing surface area. Interestingly, man-made structures that are analogous to those seen in nature often mirror those structures’ natural function. A crane arm has a similar structure to the branch of a tree, and thus serves an analogous function of hanging something away from the main body of the structure – in this case, it’s hanging the crane’s hook instead of leaves.</h2>

            <h2>Each entry was photographed with a digital camera from a similar angle, then processed using a threshold effect to emphasize the overall structure. In some cases, additional photos including scientific imagery and microscopy were sourced from the internet and treated with the same process. Each analogy is presented alongside a graphical mockup isolating the most basic form of the analogous structure. The graphical mockup is captioned with the analogous structure’s potential function. Through this archive, I hope to highlight the ways in which human design takes inspiration from nature in order to achieve a common functional goal.</h2>
